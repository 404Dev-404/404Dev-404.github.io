                <p><b>Description:</b> I was having a bad experience with SoundCloud, so I whipped this up in (a totally legally purchased copy of) Reason 12, and posted it. Despite what the drums may lead you to believe this is constantly in 4/4, I just randomly switched between 1/16, 1/16T, 1/32, and maybe 1/32T IIRC snapping mode.</p>
