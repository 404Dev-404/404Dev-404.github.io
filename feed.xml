        <title>Opera GX CSS Fix</title>
        <description>I recently began using Opera GX as my browser and it's a good browser (not as good as Firefox but it's still good.) Whilst I was checking it out I thought, "I wonder what my website looks like in Opera GX?". When I checked I saw the title at the top-left was very different from how it appears in Firefox, and the culprit was a single CSS line to make the font bold. So, once I removed the line all was solved.</description>
