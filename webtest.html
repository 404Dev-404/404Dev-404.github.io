                    <p>If you look to your left under the badges section there is a badge reading "<i>Works on</i> 3DS". When clicked on it redirects to a picture showing my website running in the 3DS Internet Browser.</i></p>
                    <p>I decided to extend this idea by loading my website on any device that: </p>
                    <ol style="font-family: Candara">
                        <li>Has Internet access</li>

                    <h2>3DS: Rating 7/10</h2>
                    <img src="images/3ds.png">
                    <p>I'd like to note that this was done 4 months ago, so it's inaccurate.</p>
                    <p>The website took a long time to load in, the SR20DET GIF did not play, the "Uhh here is a badge" badge did not show up, and the logo/header did not move. It could be that the features were too new, the 3DS couldn't handle it, or the browser doesn't implement it.</p>

                    <h2>PlayStation 3: Rating 10/10</h2>
                    <img src="images/ps3.png" width="90%">
                    <p>Worked perfectly (the PS3 is essentially a computer after all, OtherOS was a thing), although the animation didn't work but I didn't notice.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Wii: Rating NaN/10</h2>
                    <p>Doesn't load.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Windows 7/IE11: Rating NaN/10</h2>
                    <p>Someone told me (I forgot who, probably kazo) it didn't load and I tested it myself at one point and it also didn't load.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>DSi Browser (on 3DS): Rating NaN/10</h2>
                    <p>I think the DSi Browser is just the Wii one. Didn't load.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>HP EliteBook 840 G6: Rating 11/10</h2>
                    <img src="images/laptop.png" width="100%">
                    <p>I'm literally making this page on it right now.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Fire TV Stick: Rating TBD/10</h2>
                    <p>I have to check what's wrong with it because it's bootlooping, also I don't think there's even a browser for Fire TV.</p>
